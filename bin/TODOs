Items marked with X below here are done in version 0.3-7

001  _X_ Get example simd working (Greg)

002  ___ Get example assertok_errors working (Greg)

003  ___ Get example target-in-other-source working (Greg)

004  _X_ Add cudaclang examples dir and example.  Nvidia only for now
         Greg promoted the fixup-fatbin clang tool written by
         Andrey so gcn examples can build. I also cleaned
         up the cudaclang makefile and gave to Jan for testing. (Jan)

005  ___ Add hc examples dir and an hc example.  amdgcn only for now
         (Greg)

006  _X_ Get cloc.sh utility working. The utility is now in hcc2-rt
         Examples for compiling OpenCL and Cuda kernels are in 
         hcc2/examples/cloc (Greg)

007  ___ Add Debian packaging control files to this bin directory
         with versions for amd64, ppc64el, and aarch64
         Can we make libamdgcn a noarch pachage? (Greg)

008  ___ Fix driver to allow for multiple offload targets (Greg)

009  ___ Move vprintfl to atmi 0.4 device library (Guansong)

010  ___ Get a public version of the ATMI source code available (Ashwin)

011  ___ Add the cuda clang runtime for amdgcn (Jan)

012  _X_ Remove need for ncurses lib when building set-linkage

013  ___ Add printf capability to hc and opencl , need 005 006 (Greg)

014  ___ Move to new rocm device lib atomics for atmi services
         atomic_load_explicit(...)
         atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(...)
         needs 009 (Guansong)

015  ___ Create a fail message (in driver) if libamdgcn not installed 
         when --cuda-gpu-arch=gfxXXX. Also, create a fail message when 
         --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_XXX and cuda is not installed. (Guansong)

016  ___ Reverse Makefile warnings for LIBAMDGCN and HCC2 env variables (Andrey)

017  ___ Merge with latest yorktown coral repos (Greg)

018  _X_ make utilities in hcc2-rt/utils/bin executable with package
         install, needs 007 

019  ___ Test on carrizo and good HSA installed kaveris  

020  ___ Add autodiscover of subarch/gpu for both amdgcn and nvptx (Greg)

021  ___ Make printf more robust, especially with large blocks 
         where all lanes are active. Create and use a new atmi service
         for wvprintf which works for an entire wavefront. 
         This should also fix examples that fail when they are built 
         with OFFLOAD_DEBUG=1 turned on.  (Greg)

022  ___ Run omp test suite (Andrey)

023  ___ Test SpecAccel benchmark (Andrey)

024  ___ Move examples/openmp to examples/test and put simple useful
         examples in examples/openmp in self-contained directories
         (no Makefile.defs etc.) (Andrey)

025  ___ Add only OS dependencies to packages. libelf-dev? libc++1
         Do not add ROCm or CUDA dependencies. These need to be
         part of the improved messages in 015 task. (Greg)
         
026  ___ URGENT!!! Change the submit bug report message from 
         “PLEASE submit a bug report to http://llvm.org/bugs/” to
         “PLEASE open an issue in https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hcc2”
         (Guansong) 

027  ___ Replace the use of macro GPUCC_AMDGC in libomptarget/deviceRTLs/amdgcn
         with __AMDGCN__.  Do not set __AMDGCN__ in the cmake file.  This is set 
         automatically by clang in getTargetDefines in the file 
         hcc2-clang/lib/Basic/Targets/AMDGPU.cpp. (Guangsong)
