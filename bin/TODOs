         (0.4-X)

015  ___ Create a fail message (in driver) if libamdgcn not installed 
         when --cuda-gpu-arch=gfxXXX. Also, create a fail message when 
         --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_XXX and cuda is not installed. (Guansong)

         (0.4-X)

021  ___ Make printf more robust, especially with large blocks 
         where all lanes are active. Create and use a new atmi service

         This should also fix examples that fail when they are built

         (0.3-9)

         (Guansong) 

027  _X_ Replace the use of macro GPUCC_AMDGC in libomptarget/deviceRTLs/amdgcn
