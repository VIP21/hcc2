002  _X_ Move to trunk branches for 180727  (0.5-1)

003  _X_ Fix problem with missing omp.h on nvidia smoke tests (0.5-1)

004  ___ Run smoke tests in debug mode and get them working. Depends on 029

005  ___ demo use of debugging runtime in at least one openmp example (0.5-2 Andrey)

009  ___ Fix vprintfl to only use a single atomic. Requires changes
         to the hsa plugin.  Requires 029

010  ___ Get a public version of the ATMI source code available (Ashwin)
         Note: ATMI libs and devicelibs are built into the release. 
         This is only a problem for people building from source. (0.5-3 Ashwin)

011  ___ Merge hip, cuda2gcn, and some functions from libomptarget
         somewhere in libomptarget/deviceRTLs but not in amdgcn/src. 

012  ___ Check install and applcation build on systems WITHOUT cuda or rocm. 
         Make sure runtime gives a good message if no available runtime 
         for any of the available offload images.
012.b ___ Need to get hip build and install not to depend on HCC compiler.
         Greg Emailed Sam about this. 

013  _X_ Get stream example working (Greg and Jan 0.5-2)
013.b  _X_ Remove vectorization warnings with SIMD. 

014  ___ test proxy apps (requires 013)

015  ___ Test on carrizo and good HSA installed kaveris  

016  ___ Test SpecAccel benchmark (Andrey requires 013)

017  ___ Review READMEs for all examples

018  _X_ Check the bug report message in hcc2. llvm is 
         “PLEASE submit a bug report to http://llvm.org/bugs/” 
         Our messages should be
         “PLEASE open an issue in https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hcc2”
         The URL is set in a cmake option. See update to build_hcc2.sh
          (Greg 0.5-2)

019 _X_ Fix the __AMDGCN__ macro to have the gfx name that is being compiled.
019b _X_ Turn on HIP macros with openmp for gfx processors
          (Greg 0.5-2) 

020 ___  Get status of Chip's OpenMP Apps on AMDGPU and Nvidia 

024 _X_  Move to latest version of hip development repository (0.5-2)
024b _X_ Install entire HIP repository

026 ___  Move to latest version of rocm-device-libs (Greg 0.5-3)

027 _X_  Fix build_hip.sh script to get version from the version file in this bin directory.
027b _X_  Fix build_hip.sh script to build and install ALL HIP components. 
         (Greg)

028 ___ Update services to use asynchronous streams instead of end-of-kernel services. 

029 _X_ Improve performance of end-of-kernel services buffer management (Ashwin 0.5-2)

029 ___ Fix driver for make -S and -c for amdgcn.  Works for nvidia cuda. 

030 ___ Fix llc taking a long time. 
 
031 ___ Replace __smid to some type of blockid (Ashwin 0.5-3)

032 ___ Add current directory to include search path
        DEFER till problem returns.

033 ___ Test eigen with hip clang , not with hipcc.

034 ___ Use cherry picking process to build future dev releases (Greg)

035 _X_ Fix issue_002 (0.5-2) the -g flag turns on dwarf debugging. 
        For openmp this requires the generation of a debug wrapper.  
        The address space management for pointers in this wrapper 
        is failing on both nvptx and amdgcn.  So for now we turn off
        dwarf debugging for both nvptx and amdgcn.  The -g option 
        will still generate dwarf debug information for the host. 

036 ___ Fix issue_apps_001, find missing functions for lulesh in smoke test issue  .
        Current fail is on last link step. 
        (Andrey 0.5-3)

037 ___ Check the output of smoketest pfspecifier.  Are values correct?
        (Andrey 0.5-3)
         
Remaining TODOS for 0.5-2:  NONE!   We are now in a freeze to build 0.5-2 packages. 

100 ___ Move this list to Git Issues when things slow down.
