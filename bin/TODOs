004  _X_ Add cudaclang examples dir and example.  Nvidia only for now
         Greg promoted the fixup-fatbin clang tool written by
         Andrey so gcn examples can build. I also cleaned
         up the cudaclang makefile and gave to Jan for testing. (Jan)

005  ___ Add hc examples dir and an hc example.  amdgcn only for now
         (Greg)  0.4-1

         Examples for compiling OpenCL and Cuda kernels are in 
         hcc2/examples/cloc (Greg)

007  ___ Add Debian packaging control files to this bin directory
         with versions for amd64, ppc64el, and aarch64
         (Greg) (0.4-1)

009  _X_ Move vprintfl to atmi 0.4 device library (Guansong)
         (0.3-9)

010  ___ Get a public version of the ATMI source code available (Ashwin)
         Note: ATMI libs and devicelibs are built into the release. 
         This is only a problem for people building from source.
         (TBD)

011  ___ Add the cuda clang runtime for amdgcn (Jan)
         (0.4-X) 

012  _X_ Remove need for ncurses lib when building set-linkage

014  _X_ Move to new rocm device lib atomics for atmi services
         atomic_load_explicit(...)
         atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(...)
         needs 009 (Guansong)
         (0.3-9)

015  ___ Create a fail message (in driver) if libamdgcn not installed 
         when --cuda-gpu-arch=gfxXXX. Also, create a fail message when 
         --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_XXX and cuda is not installed. (Guansong)
         (0.4-X)

020  ___ Add autodiscover of subarch/gpu for both amdgcn and nvptx (Greg)
         (0.4-X)

021  ___ Make printf more robust, especially with large blocks 
         where all lanes are active. Create and use a new atmi service
         for wvprintf which works for an entire wavefront. 
         This should also fix examples that fail when they are built 
         with OFFLOAD_DEBUG=1 turned on.  (Greg)
         (0.4-X)

022  ___ Run omp test suite (Andrey)

         examples in examples/openmp in self-contained directories
         (no Makefile.defs etc.) (Andrey)
         (0.3-9)

025  ___ Add only OS dependencies to packages. libelf-dev? libc++1
         Do not add ROCm or CUDA dependencies. These need to be
         part of the improved messages in 015 task. (Greg)
         (0.4-X)

026  _X_ URGENT!!! Change the submit bug report message from 
         “PLEASE submit a bug report to http://llvm.org/bugs/” to
         “PLEASE open an issue in https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hcc2”
         (Guansong) 

027  _X_ Replace the use of macro GPUCC_AMDGC in libomptarget/deviceRTLs/amdgcn
         with __AMDGCN__.  Do not set __AMDGCN__ in the cmake file.  This is set 
         automatically by clang in getTargetDefines in the file 
         hcc2-clang/lib/Basic/Targets/AMDGPU.cpp. (Guansong)

028  ___ Fix build of libamdgcn.  Unresolved refs to __opencl_atomic ... _4
         in the opencl.bc (Guansong)

029 ___  Switch from using git branches to git tag for releases. We should 
         then be able to attach full deb and rpms to the release without 
         the need for gitlfs as we currently do in packages directory. 
         (Andrey)
