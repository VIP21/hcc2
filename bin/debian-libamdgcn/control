Description: LLVM bitcode libraries for amdgcn target architectures.
 Contains bitcode libraries optimized for many amdgpu (Radeon)
 processors.  This package is required for hcc2 for building 
 applications with amdgcn targets. Since hcc2 can build for 
 other targets, hcc2 does not force this package to be required. 
 This is a noarch package because the bitcode libraries can be
 used on any platform (amd64, ppc64le, or aarch64).
