  *   Merge yorktown coral CLANG 4.0 compiler as of Nov 15, 2017 
  *     This provides significant enhancements for synthesized GPU kernels. 
  *   Support for optimized libomptarget bc libraries for multiple nvptx subarchs 
  *   Support for cudaclang for both nvidia and amdgcn targets
  *   specification of the target on command line changed to -march=
  *     This may change again in the future
  *   autodetect the target of the current machine with the mygpu script
  *   all smoke tests now run for both nvidia and amdgcn targets. 
  *     stream test still does not vectorize
  *   Stop using release branches in our github.  We now use github release mechanism
  *     and attach deb and rpm files to the release
  *   Tasklist is currently managed in hcc2/hcc2/bin/TODOs. 
  *   Testing removed from "examples" directory into test/smoke directories. 
  *   Added test/omptests directory for enhanced testing. 
  * 0.5-0 is a major upgrade
  *   This clang 7.0 is a large patch to support OpenMP on amdgcn.  
  *   Patch is against the clang and openmp development trunks as of 
  *   July 18 2018
  * 0.5-1 
  *   Cleanup the atmi-staging repo
  *   Fix smoke tests vmulsum and assertok_error caused by missing smid function for amdgcn
  *   Fixed the cuda toolchain to pickup includes from the compiler install first. 
  * 0.5-2 
  *   Fix all smoke tests except reduce and issue_apps_001
  *   The __AMDGCN__ compiler macro now provides the gfx number
  *   The bug message now points to the correct URL to report bugs. 
  *   Started an initial list of limitations
  *   Includes llvm/clang/openmp/lld trunk updates up to Aug 8, 2018. 
  *      We are now at llvm/clang 8.0.0 
  * 0.5-3 
  *   Lower the thread_limit to 512 for amdgcn. Can still have many teams.
  *   Created a new kernel launch trace option with envvar LIBOMPTARGET_KERNEL_DEBUG
  *   Cleaned up some compilation warnings in the build of openmp libraries
  *   Removed c++ delete functions from the libomptarget device runtime.
  *     Destructors should not be generated on the device pass. 
  *   Now building HCC2 with a public available version of ATMI.
  *   Add addrspace cast in emitGenericVarsProlog because some of the captured 
  *     variables may be from a kernel arg in address space 1, so we need to cast 
  *     to generic.  This fixes some of the OPenMP Proxy apps.
  *   Fix driver error when extra libs are specified on the command line such as -lm. 
  *     Now applications that need standard host libraries should run.
  *   Cleaned up example openmp makefiles and the README for openmp examples.
  *   Fixed the unbundle.sh script to work with amdgcn .o files. 
  *
