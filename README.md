HCC2 - V 0.3-7
==============

hcc2:  Heterogeneous Compiler Collection (Version 2). 

This is README.md for https:/github.com/ROCM-Developer-Tools/hcc2 .  This is the master repository for HCC2,  Use this for issues, documentation, packaging, examples, build.  

HCC2 is a prototype that is intended to support multiple programming models including OpenMP 4.5+, C++ parallel extentions (original HCC), and cuda clang.  It supports offloading to multiple GPU acceleration targets(multi-target).  It also supports different host platforms such as AMD64, PPC64LE, and AARCH64. (multi-platform). 

The bin directory of this 
repository contains a README and build scripts needed to build HCC2.

Attention Developers!   Please only update the current development branch.  Do not update the master.  Do not put development source code here other than examples and build scripts.  From time to time, we will pull changes to the master from their original location and then update our development branch. Please read the section below describing the different repositories needed for HCC2. 

Attention Users and Developers!  Do not build from the master branch.  You must build from the release branch or the development branch.  See the README in bin/README. 

Attention Users!  Use this repository for issues.   Do not put issues in the source code repositories.

## HCC2 Repositories

<A NAME="Repositories">
The hcc2 compiler is an LLVM and CLANG 5 compiler.  It requires a number of repositories to build

### hcc2-clang
https:/github.com/ROCM-Developer-Tools/hcc2-clang
```
Original: 		https://github.com/radeonOpenCompute/hcc-clang-upgrade  branch:clang_tot_upgrade
Master Branch :  	master
Current Release Branch: none
Current Dev Branch:  	0.3-6
```
The master branch of this repository is a clone of the HCC development branch clang_tot_upgrade. That clone containes support for the new address space and alloca in address space 5 (local). 

The development and release branches contains significant changes to support OpenMP 4.5. OpenMP 4.5 changes were taken from the IBM coral compiler (clang repository). This compiler supports nvptx64 backend.   Then significant changes were made to support Radeon GPUs (amdgcn).  Both nvptx64 and amdgcn targets are supported by HCC2. 


### hcc2-llvm
https:/github.com/ROCM-Developer-Tools/hcc2-llvm
```
Original: 		https://github.com/radeonOpenCompute/llvm   branch:amd-hcc
Master Branch:  	master 
Current Release Branch: none
Current Dev Branch:  	0.3-6
```
The master branch of this repository is a clone of the HCC development branch amd-hcc taken on June 27, 2017.  It containes the amdgcn backend to support the new address space scheme (Generic-is-zero) and alloca in address space 5 (local).  The only llvm repository updates we need for hcc2 are to accept the osname "cuda" in the triple to trigger the new address space scheme.  Both OpenMP offloading and Cuda Clang languages require the osname "cuda".  The Nvidia CUDA operating environment is only needed when specifying an nvptx64 target. 


### hcc2-lld
https:/github.com/ROCM-Developer-Tools/hcc2-lld
```
Original: 		https://github.com/radeonOpenCompute/lld   branch:amd-hcc
Master Branch:  	master This is a copy of amd-hcc as of June 27
Current Release Branch: none
Current Dev Branch:  	0.3-6
```
The master branch of this repository is a clone of the HCC development branch amd-hcc.   There are no changes to lld to support hcc2.  So the develoment branch is identical to the master branch. 


### hcc2-rt
https:/github.com/ROCM-Developer-Tools/hcc2-rt
```
Original: 		https://github.com/clang-ykt/openmp branch:master
Master Branch:  	master This is a copy of original master(ykk) as of June 27)
Current Release Branch: none
Current Dev Branch:  	0.3-6
```
This repository is a clone of the IBM Coral compiler openmp runtime with significant updates to support AMDGCN.
