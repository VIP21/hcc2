Because we cannot easily fix the hip or rocm-device-libs repositories,
we add these files for our installer to fix repositories that HCC2
depends on .  

Eventually if these fixes are accepted by the AMD team, we can remove
them from this file and update our build scripts. 

hip_host_runtime_api.h 
   The build_hip.sh script adds this to the headers that get installed 
   into $HCC2/lib/clang/7.0.0/include/hip.  The current hip headers
   have no way to just include the host api without bringing in all 
   the device header support that conflicts with a clang cuda 
   compilation of cuda device code using the cuda_open or cuda headers. 
   This file is used when automatic mode includes 
   includes __clang_cuda_runtime_wrapper_open.h or 
   __clang_cuda_runtime_wrapper.h . It is likely that unless HIP 
   automatic mode is accepted upstream, then this file will not 
   be accepted by the hip development team.  So it is expected to 
   be maintained here for several HCC2 releases. 

opencuda2gcn.ll
   This file is used by the build_libdevice.sh script which we 
   use to customize the build of the rocm-device-libs. 
   The rocm-device-libs has a directory called cuda2gcn. 
   That is used to build the bc library cuda2gcn.bc.
   This file implements nvvm intrinsics that are generated by 
   cuda and cuda_open headers for amdgcn. The CGBuiltin.cpp file in 
   clang converts these intrinics into function calls with similar
   names and the EXACT same interface.  The functions in this file
   implement those function names.  This file is added to the 
   directory cuda2gcn/src. 

rocdl.patch
   This file is also used by the build_libdevice.sh script.
   The patch to CMakeList.txt just enables the cuda2gcn directory
   when the builder of rocm-device-libs specifies -DBUILD_CUDA2GCN=on
   The 2nd part of the patch cleans up cuda2gcn/CMakeLIsts.txt
